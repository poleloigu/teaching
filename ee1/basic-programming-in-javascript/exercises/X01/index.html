    <h1>Excercises</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make an array of people attending an event, both first name and last
        name and print their last and first name into console.
      </li>
      <li>
        The event they would like to go to is an 21+ event. So everyone aged
        less than 21 cannot get inside.
      </li>
      <li>Print out all males or females that went to the 21+ event.</li>
      <li>
        For current safety reasons we must randomly give every person a 50%
        chance of getting in.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a persons first or last name starts with C, G, F, L, X or W they
        sadly cannot come in to the event. Write the alert/console message for
        which letter they cannot be admitted for.
      </li>
